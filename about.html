<p>This page tells you a little bit about me and my blog.</p>

<p>I am Jack, a 20-year-old first-year Computer Science student. I am very interested in artificial intelligence, alignment, AI saftey, AI ethics, and neural networks.</p>

<p>This blog is a place for me to organise my thoughts and my notes whilst I go through the process of trying to understand artificial intelligence and the impact that it is going to have on the world.</p>

<p>This blog is primarly a resource for me, whereas the main arinteli site is primarily a resource for others. Therefore posts here may be less guided or flat out incomprehensible, whereas I will try my best to make main site posts welcoming and well explained. In general, I will try to keep my thoughts and opinions on this blog, whilst keeping informative posts on the main site.</p>

<p>This blog will also hopefully serve as writing practice for me. I will try to improve my style and coherence with each post I publish.</p>

<h2 id="my-goals">My goals</h2>

<p>This section is about my long-term life goals. It being long-term, I hope that I will not have to frequently update this section.</p>

<p>The date next to each goal is the date in which it was added to this list. Any goals which are struck through have been removed from this list.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Visit the moon</strong>. My number one goal. Probably banking on space tourism here rather than being an astronaut.</li>
  <li><strong>Learn to think better</strong> by understanding thought processes and human cognition. My initial plan for this is to read more about being a rationalist. I think a base understanding of this will be a good start. [19.02.2023]</li>
  <li><strong>Improve my focus.</strong> Break free from generation goldfish. [19.02.2023]</li>
  <li><strong>Keep a document of my thoughts.</strong> This includes every dumb idea I have, every interesting thing I learn, and every mistake I make. I initially plan for these to be in text and video format. [19.02.2023]</li>
  <li><strong>Artificial intelligence</strong> is something I plan to achieve a high-level / mid-level understanding of. [19.02.2023]</li>
  <li><strong>Human biology and medicine</strong> are something I plan to achieve a high-level / mid-level understanding of. [19.02.2023]</li>
</ul>
